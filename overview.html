                    Welcome to the Brain Simulation Platform.
                    <br />
                    The Brain Simulation Platform enables the reconstruction and simulation of scaffold models of brain and brain tissue in a data-driven approach.  
                    This is version 2 of the Platform, which was released at the beginning of June 2017, following feedback from a recent review process by external reviewers and the European Commission.

                <div class="one-half column category">
                    For version 2, the Platform has been re-organised to be more user-centric and user-friendly, so that users, with different neuroscientific and/or technical backgrounds and expertise levels, can benefit and use the Platform’s capabilities for their scientific goals and curiosity.

    This is the first public prototype of the Brain Simulation Platform. It entails functionality spearheaded in the first 30 months of the HBP, of a total 10 year development cycle. Accordingly, the functionality at this point has different levels of maturity and public accessibility. In brief, many of the fundamental software packages that the Platform relies on and develops, are freely available as open source.

    Intricate pipelines for reconstruction and simulation are packaged into web-accessible workflows, showcased as use cases, typically requiring privileged access. Lastly, using these tools and workflows, the Platform hosts team-science Collabs for collaborative building of scaffold models of different brain regions, serving as co-design drivers for the Platform.

                <p class="section-description">The Platform is available to all interested researchers, but as with most scientific instruments, access to advanced functionality may be subject to certain conditions. This is due to the early state of the Platform and to the fact that it relies on limited resources, such as supercomputers. The Platform enables researchers to work collaboratively on converging models, by creating a common workplace (Collab) and a common workflow for building, simulating and validating models. Researchers can also add their tools to the Platform.   </p>
